# GarminDB

[Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts for parsing health data into and manipulating data in a [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) database. SQLite is a light weight database that doesn't require a server.

What they can do:
* Automatically download and import Garmin daily monitoring files (all day heart rate, activity, climb/descend, stress, and intensity minutes) from the user's Garmin Connect "Daily Summary" page.
* Extract sleep, weight, and resting heart rate data from Garmin Connect, store it as JSON files, and import it into the DB.
* Download and import activity files from Garmin Connect. A summary table for all activities and more detailed data for some activity types. Lap and record entries for activities.
* Summarizing data into a DB with tables containing daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries.
* Graph your data from the commandline or with Jupyter notebooks.
* Retain downloaded JSON and FIT files so that the DB can be regenerated without connecting to or redownloading data from Garmin Connect.
* Export activities as TCX files.

Once you have your data in the DB, I recommend using a supplied Jupyter notebooks, third party Jupyter notebooks, and/or SQLite browser like [SQLite Studio](http://sqlitestudio.pl), [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/), or [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) for browsing and working with the data. The scripts create some default [views](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_views.htm) in the DBs that make browsing the data easier.

# Using It

## Releases

GarminDb releases are hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/garmindb/). GarminDb requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.x. With Python installed, install the latest release with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) by running `pip install garmindb` in a terminal.
* Copy [`GarminConnectConfig.json.example`](https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB/raw/master/garmindb/GarminConnectConfig.json.example) to `~/.GarminDb/GarminConnectConfig.json`, edit it, and add your Garmin Connect username and password and adjust the start dates to match the dates of your data in Garmin Connect.
* Starting out: download all of your data and create your db by running `garmindb_cli.py --all --download --import --analyze` in a terminal.
* Incrementally update your db by downloading the latest data and importing it by running `garmindb_cli.py --all --download --import --analyze --latest` in a terminal.
* Ocassionally run `garmindb_cli.py --backup` to backup your DB files.

Update to the latest release with `pip install --upgrade garmindb`.

## From Source

The scripts are automated with [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html). Run the Make commands in a terminal window.

* Git clone GarminDB repo using the [SSH clone method](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone#git-clone-with-ssh). The submodules require you to use SSH and not HTTPS. Get the command from the green button on the project home page.
* Run `make setup` in the cloned tree to get the scripts ready to process data.
* Copy [`GarminConnectConfig.json.example`](https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB/raw/master/garmindb/GarminConnectConfig.json.example) to `~/.GarminDb/GarminConnectConfig.json`, edit it, and add your Garmin Connect username and password and adjust the start dates to match the dates of your data in Garmin Connect.
* Run `make create_dbs` once to fetch and process for you data.
* Keep all of your local data up to date by periodically running only one command: `make`.

There is more help on [using the program](https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB/wiki/Usage) in the wiki.

# Jupyter Notebooks #

Jupyter notebooks for analyzing data from the database can be found in the 'Jupyter' directory in the source tree. [Links](https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB/wiki/Related-Projects#jupyter-notebooks) to user submitted notebooks can be found in the wiki.

# Plugins #

Plugins allow the user to expand the types of data that are processed and stored in the database. GarminDb already has a number of plugins for handling data from third-party Connect IQ apps and data fields. Read more about plugins [here](https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDbPlugins).

# Success Stories

# Notes

* You may get a DB version exception after updating the code, this means that the DB schema was updated and you need to rebuild your DBs by running `garmindb_cli.py --rebuild_db`. Your DBs will be regenerated from the previously downloaded data files. All of your data will not be redownloaded from Garmin.
* The scripts were developed on MacOS. Information or patches on using these scripts on other platforms are welcome.
* When a database update finishes, a summary of the data in the DB will be saved to stats.txt. The output includes the date ranges included in the downloaded daily monitoring files and activities. It includes the number of records for daily monitoring, activities, sleep, resting heart rate, weight, etc. Use the summary information to determine if all of your data has been downloaded from Garmin Connect. If not, adjust the dates in GarminConnectConfig.json and runt he download again.
* In `GarminConnectConfig.json` the "steps" element of the "course_views" is list of course ids that per course database views will be generated for. The database view allows you to compare all activities from that course.

# Bugs and Debugging

* If you have issues, file a bug here on the project. See the Issues tab at the top of the project page. Run `make bugreport` or `garmindb_bug_report.py` and include bugreport.txt in your bug report.
* Besides errors that appear on the screen, one of the first places to look for more information is the log files (garmindb.log).
* If you're having issues with a particular data files, please considering sharing so I can debug it and add support.
